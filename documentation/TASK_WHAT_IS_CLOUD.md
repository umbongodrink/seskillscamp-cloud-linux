# Understand what is the Cloud

## How do we know if something is in the cloud?

- Remote Access across multiple devices as long as you have internet connectivity
- Constant Availability with 99.9% uptime
- Data storage on remote servers by a provider like Google Drive, Dropbox or iCloud
- No local copies
- Accessing software through a web browser (rather than an installed application)

## Differences between On-Prem and the Cloud

### On Premise

- **Ownership**: you own and manage the hardware and software infrastructure
- **Location**: data and applications are stored on your own servers, typically located on your own premises, in your own buildings or rented spaces
- **Control**: you have complete control over your infrastructure including security, updates and maintenance
- **Costs**: High initial investment costs (CapEx) for hardware, software and IT Staff. Plus continuing operational costs (OpEx).
- **Scalability**: Less flexible and time-consuming to scale resources up and down

### Cloud

- **Ownership**: A third-party cloud provider owns and manages the infrastructure. 
- **Location**: Data and applications are stored on remote servers owned by a cloud provider (e.g. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Digital Ocean, etc)
- **Control**: You have limited control over the underlying infrastructure but manage your data and applications
- **Costs**: Pay as you go model with lower upfront costs and discounted volume purchasing
- **Scalability**: Highly scalable, allowing you to quickly adjust resources based on demand

## The 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud - Differences?

| Feature   | Public Cloud  | Private Cloud | Hybrid Cloud  | Multi-Cloud   |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Ownership | Third-Party   | Organisation  | Combination   | Multiple providers    |
| Security  | Shared    | High  | Balanced  | Complex   |
|Scalability    | High  | Less flexible | Hybrid    | High  |
| Cost  | Pay-as-you-go | Higher upgront    | Hybrid    | Potential cost optimisation   |
| Use Cases | General purpose   | Sensitive data    | Bursting workloads or disaster recovery   | Optimizing costs, avoiding vendor lock in |


## How do the 4 types of cloud work (Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi-Cloud)?

- **Public**: 3rd party owns and manages the infrastructure (e.g. Google, Amazon, etc)
- **Private**: A company/organisation owns and operates the cloud infrastructure
- **Hybrid**: a combination of public and private cloud infrastructure
- **Multi**: different cloud providers are combined.

## Explain the types of cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, Saas)?

- **IaaS**: the cloud company provides the fundamental computer resources such as servers, storage, CPUs and networking (EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engines)
- **PaaS**: the cloud company provides a platform developing, testing and deploying applications (Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service)
- **SaaS**: the cloud company provides software applications over the internt (Google Workspace, Salesforce, Microsoft365)


## What are the advantages/disadvantages of the cloud for a business?

- **Cost Effectiveness**: pay-as-you-go model eliminates the need for up-front investments in hardware and software. Only pay for the resources you consume.
- **Scalability**: scale resources according to demand
- **Accessibility**: due to the way the internet works (resources can be accessed from anywhere)
- **Reliability**: cloud providers invest in redundant infrastructure
